# This version is going to be FULL SMD!  
  
FT232RL as usb->serial converter  
ESP-12E/F as main chip  
  
Probably will be one sided, but I need to finish it yet.  
Main diagram is ready, including autoreset on code load.  

### May contain little misconnections. If you are brave please test this.
